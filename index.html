      <h2>Why social distance?: Visually explained</h2>
      <h4>by Dhruv Jimulia</h4>
      <h4>12th April 2020</h4>
      <p class="saying">
      "Two metres distance,<br>
      determines your existence."

        Right now, the whole world is undergoing a period of social distancing. Despite countless warnings on television and social media to stay at home,
        we often feel the need to go out of our homes. In such circumstances, we often do not realise the consequences of not following social distancing in the larger context.
        This article will demonstrate the the importance of social distancing visually via a computer simulation.</p>
        <h3>The Simulation</h3>
        <p class = "bodytext">The simulation consists of a grid of "cells", or boxes. These cells represent spaces in which people can reside. Each cell can have three states:<br>
        1. Green: Uninfected person<br>
        2. Red: Infected person<br>
        3. Black: No person present<br>
        The people in these "cells" interact like in a real-world society. They can move from one cell to another, can transmit the virus if they are close,
        and can recover from the virus. People can even use social distancing as a precautionary measure, which means that each person tries to isolate himself from others.
        Real-world transmission rates and average recovery times have been used in this simulation.</p>

        <script>
          if (window.innerHeight > window.innerWidth){
            if (window.innerWidth < 600){
              var canvasWidth = (window.innerWidth - 40) - (window.innerWidth) % 20;
              var canvasHeight = ((window.innerWidth - 40) - (window.innerWidth) % 20) + 70;
            } else {
              var canvasWidth = window.innerWidth/2;
              var canvasHeight = window.innerWidth/2 + 70;
            }
          } else if (window.innerHeight < window.innerWidth){
            if (window.innerWidth < 1000){
              var canvasWidth = (window.innerWidth/2);
              var canvasHeight = (window.innerWidth/2) + 70;
            } else {
              var canvasWidth = window.innerHeight/2;
              var canvasHeight = (window.innerHeight/2) + 70;
            }
          }
          document.getElementById("s1").setAttribute('width', canvasWidth);
          document.getElementById("s1").setAttribute('height', canvasHeight);</script>

      <p class="bodytext">

      It is clear that without social distancing, the virus can be transmitted very quickly, leaving around 60% of the population infected at any point in time.
      <b>In perspective of the world population, this means 4.7 billion people can be infected at any point in time.
      This shows how infectious the COVID-19 can be without social distancing.</b>

      <h3>With social distancing:</h3>
      <iframe id ="s3" src = "sketch-3.html" style="display:block" class = "center"></iframe>
      <script>
        document.getElementById("s3").setAttribute('width', canvasWidth);

      <p class = "bodytext">
        As you can see, implementing lockdowns restricts the spread of the virus to such an extent that eventually, no one is infected.
        <b>So it is extremely critical that everyone adheres to social distancing measures and moves outside only if absolutely necessary.</b>
        <br>
        Although this article is only about social distancing, other safety measures  maintaining hygeine, washing hands with soap, and wearing masks are also vital in
        in lowering the transmission rate.
