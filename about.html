      <h2>About</h2>
      <h3>About me and this website</h3>
      <p class="bodytext">
      Hey! I am Dhruv Jimulia and I am 16 years old. I enjoy computer science, especially its applications in
      creative coding and simulating natural systems.<br>
      At a time when COVID-19 was spreading like wildfire, nearly the whole world was in lockdown, and government was contemplating
      whether to continue the lockdown or not, this website was created to visually provide awareness about the importance of social distancing.
      The use of computer simulations makes complicated yet relevant data easy to understand for anybody.
      These simulations were created using the <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js library</a>, a JavaScript library for creative coding.
      </p>
      <h3>Simulation specifications</h3>
      <p class="bodytext">
      These are the rules I am using in my simulation to model the behaviour of the virus.</p>
      <h4>The Basics</h4>
      <p class="bodytext">
      The simulation starts with a grid of 40 rows and 40 columns. Approximately 25% of the cells have people in them.
      As mentioned earlier, any cell can have an infected person (red), uninfected person (green), or can have no person (black).
      The cell's neighbours will be defined as the cells on the top, right, bottom, and left of the cell itself.
      Each day is represented by a frame of animation. In computer science, such simulations are known as cellular automata.
      </p>
      <h4>Infection</h4>
      <p class="bodytext">
      If an unifected person has neighbours which are infected, then the uninfected person has a
      75% chance to become infected.<br>

      The number 75% is accurate because the COVID-19 is estimated to
      spread at a rate such that for every person infected, an average of three more people get
      infected (estimated average R-nought value is three). Since there are four spaces the virus can move to, the transmission
      rate is effectively 75%.
      For the MERS, the chance of infection 12.5% since the average R-nought value is estimated to be 0.5.
      </p>
      <h4>Movement</h4>
      <p class="bodytext">
      <b>If there is no social distancing:</b><br>
      If a person can move (i.e. the person does not have four neighbouring people), then it has a 50% chance of moving.<br>
      If a person moves, then it randomly chooses a neighbouring cell where a person is not present and moves there.<br>

      50% is an accurate estimate since (on average) half the family members move out of their homes in the open at any point in time.<br>
      <b>If there is social distancing:</b><br>
      If a person has 0 neighbours, it does not move.<br>
      If a person has 1 neighbour and is infected, the person moves.<br>
      If a person has 1 neighbour and is not infected, it does not move.<br>
      If a person has 2 or 3 neighbours, it moves.<br>
      If a person has 4 neighbours, it does not move. (beacause it cannot).<br>
      These rules ensure a person moves as far as possible other people, especially if the person
      is currently infected.
      </p>

      <h4>Recovery</h4>
      <p class="bodytext">
      Recovery will be defined according to whether a person is a critical case or not.
      An infected person has a 5% chance to be a critical case.<br>
      If a person is critical case, the person recovers in 32 days.<br>
      If the person is not a critical case, 14 multiplied by a random number between
      0 and 2 determines the recovery time.<br>
      14 days is the average recovery rate for mild cases. Usually, recovery times can take
      a range of values. Hence the random number system was used.
      </p>

      <h3>Credits</h3>
      <p class="bodytext">
      Although the website and the simulations were largely designed by me, there were some significant contributions by others which
      I will address here:
      The idea of a simulation to model COVID-19 was inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs&t=933s"> 3Blue1Brown's great video</a> on simulating an epidemic</a>. Yet,
      instead of using the typical SIR model to model the virus, I used my own approach using cellular automata.<br>
      My brother, Jay Jimulia, also helped me add captivating titles and proverbs for every article, meticulously edit
      the errors in style, layout and formatting.<br>
      Also, my parents played a huge role in giving their unending support and advice in layouts, testing, and uploading the
      site.<br>
      </p>
